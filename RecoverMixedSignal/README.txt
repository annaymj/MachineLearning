This is the README file for Anna Mengjie Yu's Machine Learning HW2

This zipped code file consists of 4 matlab code.

1. load_sound.m, which loads the original sound data
2. ICA.m, which implements the ICA algorithm
3. mixAndRevover_data.m, which applies ICA and recovers the original data
4. sound_plot.m, which plots the recovered, mixed and original data in one graph

Code Running Instruction: Open in MatLab, click on Run. load_sound.m will give you a graph of the original sound data.
mixAndRevover_data.m will carry out the ICA experiment.
sound_plot.m will plots the result.
